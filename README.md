# ELK-utils
Various files that are helpful for deploying ElasticStack, ingesting data into ElasticSearch or creating Kibana visualizations. Most of this is a reduced form of a Maxar Corp. project, edited to be open-source.

*ELK-resources* contains files for Docker Compose (run `docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose.yml dev`) and a logstash config file.
