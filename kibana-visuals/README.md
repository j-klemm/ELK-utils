This directory contains alpha version visualizations in kibana, and some auxillary files (import-export,mappings, scripts to post to ES). 


###Utils 
**utils** contains (gasp!) utility scripts for these visualizations/Kibana. Specifically, import-export for kibana. The other scripts were removed for this lowside repo.

###Visualization Descriptions
*polygons* is the only one we can bring lowside; it contains a simple visualization of a GeoJSON shape in Vega. The directory also contains some helper scripts to post data to ES.
