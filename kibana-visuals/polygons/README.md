Visualize GeoJSON shapes and points in Kibana with Vega


*To get data into ES:*

Assuming you have data `./localdata`, to post data to a remote cluster, modify the IP address in `./addDataToEs`. Or, if you want to add data to an ElasticSearch cluster running on your local machine, run `./postNewData.sh`

*To visualize data:*

It's easiest to copy the Vega JSON file into the visualization in the browser. Go to Visualize tab in browser -> "+" symbol -> "Vega" -> Paste JSON into text box.
